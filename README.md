# StudySync — Feature Overview (Teacher-Friendly)

StudySync is a privacy-focused study helper that lets students create and manage study subjects, save notes, track progress, and use an optional on-device AI assistant for emotional support and study tips. The app is designed to work fully offline by default and offers optional cloud sync for convenience.

## Core Features (concise, descriptive)

- User Accounts (Email & Google)
  - Secure sign-in options so students can use the app with familiar credentials. Sessions persist so users don't need to sign in every time.

- Subject CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
  - Quickly add a subject with a title, description, and progress indicator. Edit notes and progress at any time and remove subjects when finished. All changes are saved locally immediately for a responsive experience.

- Offline-First Storage
  - The app stores all content on the device so it remains usable without network access. Edits are immediate and persist across app restarts, making it reliable in low-connectivity environments.

- Optional Background Sync
  - When enabled, local changes are synchronized to a cloud backend in the background so the user's data can be backed up and shared between devices without interrupting their workflow.

- On-Device AI Assistant (Emotional Support & Study Help)
  - An optional, local AI provides empathetic responses and concise study suggestions. The assistant runs on-device so user conversations do not leave the phone, protecting privacy.

- Model Downloading for Local AI
  - The app can download a pretrained model from the project's Kaggle dataset onto the device for offline inference. If direct download is not possible, the model can be transferred to the device manually and installed.

- Privacy & Portability
  - Designed so core features and AI processing can remain fully local. This approach keeps student data private and simplifies demonstrations in classroom settings.
